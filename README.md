The purpose of this resource is to enable you to: **(1)** reproduce the key results of our recent study of immune resistance in melanoma (Jerby-Arnon _et al._); and **(2)** apply our approach to other single-cell cohorts to explore cell-cell interactions in cancer.

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/livnatje/ImmuneResistance/wiki) page for instructions and details.
